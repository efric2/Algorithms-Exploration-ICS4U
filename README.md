## The Beginning

For this Algorithm Exploration I was assigned with the task of solving a _Pyramix_. At The start of this course I had never solved a pyramix or a rubix cube before, but I has always been interested in solving one before and I decided to dedicate mysel over the course of many days to learn how to solve it. After I completed my very first solve, I was still interested in continuing my learning and getting faster times for my solves, whiuch further engaged me in my learning.

As I started to record my solves, I was able to see how much I had improved in my solving, and grow from it.
