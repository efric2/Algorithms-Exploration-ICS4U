# Algorithms-Exploration-ICS4U
Cubing Workflow Repository

## The Beginning

For this Algorithm Exploration I was assigned with the task of solving a _Pyraminx_. At The start of this course I had never solved a pyramix or a rubix cube before, but I has always been interested in solving one before and I decided to dedicate myself over the course of many days to learn how to solve it. After I completed my very first solve, I was still interested in continuing my learning and getting faster times for my solves, which further engaged me in my learning.

## My Strategy
Learning from my peers, I was able to develop a starting strategy, which was to align the "middle" triangles with their same colour, leaving me with the 3 base triangles I needed to help solve the _Pyraminx_. After doing that, I aligned the "point" triangle pieces with their correlating colours and began solving further from there. I analyzed the _Pyraminx_ in multiple different ways in order to move forward in my solves, which is why I believe that some of my times were way longer than others.

As I started to record my solves though, I was able to see how much I had improved in my solving, and grow from it.

## My Solves
Pyramix Solve(s) Completed on March 10th

ao5 : 48.80

ao12 : 48.66

ao25 : 1:05.90m

Pyraminx Solve(s) Completed on March 24th

### My Best Time
My best time occured on my 28th solve though, which was **0:22.51**. Even though this number wasn't included in my averages, I am very proud of it as I worked hard to reduce my times over the course of so many solves.
